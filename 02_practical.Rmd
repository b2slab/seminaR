## Getting started

We will clone a minimal package by Yihui Xie called `mini` 
and work on it as it was our own starting project.
Note: this practical exercise needs a working internet connection.

First, a boring configuration chunk that sets up the 
new directory `rmini` as the default working directory.

```{r setup}
# delete rmini directory if it already exists
unlink("rmini", recursive = TRUE)
dir.create("rmini")

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = normalizePath("rmini"))
```

```{r getwd}
# Current directory
getwd()
```

```{r load_packages, results='hide', message=FALSE}
# CRAN packages
# require("knitr")
require("rmarkdown")
require("plyr")
require("devtools")
require("testthat")
require("roxygen2")

# Bioconductor packages
require("BiocCheck")
# if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
#     install.packages("BiocManager")
# BiocManager::install("BiocCheck", version = "3.8")
```


## Git/GitHub

First, we will clone the package. 
It it was our starting project, this would probably be an empty repository.

```{bash clone}
git clone https://github.com/yihui/rmini .
ls
```

To see the current status (commits, changes) of the repo:

```{bash git_status1}
git status
```

Where did we get this repo from, i.e. who is `origin`? 
And where will we be pushing?

```{bash git_remote}
git remote -v
```

Specific data about local branches, highlighting the current one

```{bash git_branch}
git branch -v
```

Let's create a new experimental branch to add new features!
To avoid breaking the main working version, we will move to this 
new `crazy_idea` branch.

```{bash git_newbranch}
# create branch
git branch crazy_idea
# move to it
git checkout crazy_idea

git branch -v
```

We can see how a new branch appeared and that we are working on it.
Let's make our first big contribution by changing the `README.md` file 
and by adding a `NEWS` and a `LICENSE` file:

```{bash newfiles}
echo "I just appended this line!" >> "README.md"
touch NEWS LICENSE
```

See how `git` spots the changes:

```{bash git_status2}
git status
```

We will be adding only the (already tracked) `README.md` and the 
(untracked) `NEWS` files in this commit:

```{bash git_status3}
git add README.md NEWS
git status
```

Now that we have added all of our changes, let's commit:

```{bash git_commit1}
git commit -m "My first commit"
```

If this was our repo, we would be able to push our changes to the remote repo. 
This is not the case, so I have commented the line.
Note how we can specify which branch we want to push.

```{bash git_push}
# git push origin crazy_idea
```

In case we wanted to pull changes from remote, we would do the following:

```{bash git_pull}
git pull origin master
```

However, the remote hasn't changed since we started this session, 
so we are already up-to-date with it.

Finally, let's pretend that we have tested our crazy changes 
and that we want to incorporate them into `master`:

```{bash git_merge}
git checkout master
git merge crazy_idea
```

Now we are standing in `master` again, with our changes merged, 
and the `LICENSE` file should still be hanging around, untracked:

```{bash git_status4}
git status
```

By repeating this cycle you will be able to build your project 
incrementally and safely. 
In case anything breaks down, you can just go back to the latest commit 
that worked properly.
You can commit directly to `master`, or commit several times on an 
experimental branch before merging.

`git` is a powerful and convenient tool to manage software projects. 
Using it is of your interest.

## Basic devtools commands

### Loading the package

We can load all the functions and documentation from the package 
without needing to install it:

```{r dev_load}
devtools::load_all()
```

Let's see if the functions are visible:

```{r ls}
# objects in package
ls("package:rmini")
```

So far, so good. 
For instance, the `rock_fun` function and its documentation 
using `?rock_fun`:

```{r rock_fun}
rock_fun
```

### Documentation files and roxygen2

We can re-generate the `.Rd` files automatically

```{r dev_docu}
devtools::document()
```

... but `roxygen2` won't be able to do it because it does not 
recognise the files as generated by it. 
We will remove them and force `roxygen2` to rebuild everything.

```{r dev_docu2}
# delete old config files
unlink("man/*")
devtools::document()
```

We can see the extent of the changes with `git`

```{bash git_status5}
git status
```

See how some `.o` files appear in `src/`. 
We can ignore them by modifying `.gitignore`:

```{bash git_status6}
echo "src/*.o" >> .gitignore
echo "src/*.so" >> .gitignore

git status
```

That's better. 
Let's see what changed in the `DESCRIPTION` file:

```{bash git_diff}
git diff DESCRIPTION
```

We will accept all the changes and move on. 
Usually you would also edit by hand the version number and the `NEWS` file.

```{bash git_commit2}
git add .
git commit -m "Updated doc files"
```

### Testing and checking

The unit testing can be run with `devtools::test()`, but 
this package does not have the standard folder structure 
`tests/testthat`. 

```{r testthat}
# This one won't work
# devtools::test(path = "tests") 
```

There is a file for testing though, `tests/test-split.R`. 
We can force its execution, but the `testthat` syntax is missing 
and therefore no tests are detected (although the file is actually run):

```{r test_dir}
testthat::test_dir("tests/", filter = "split")
```

On the other hand, the function examples:

```{r run_examples}
devtools::run_examples()
```

The whole package check for CRAN:

```{r cran_check}
devtools::check(error_on = "never")
```

And the same thing for Bioconductor:

```{r bioc_check}
BiocCheck::BiocCheck()
```

Looks like we would have some work ahead to make this package 
CRAN and Bioconductor compliant!

## Exercises

### 1. Fix the `avoid 1:...` NOTE 

Make sure it disappears from `BiocCheck`

### 2. Add an argument to rock_fun

Add the `caps` argument to `rock_fun`, so that the user 
can chose whether to use caps. 
In other words, if `caps = TRUE`, sample from `LETTERS`, 
otherwise from `letters`. 

Remember: you need to update the docs accordingly.

### 3. Add a new dependency: plyr

Rewrite the `for` loop in `rock_fun` in terms of `plyr::l_ply`. 
You can type `?plyr::l_ply` for help.

Remember: you need to update the dependencies and to make 
a decision on how to import `plyr`. 

Hint: after this, the files `NAMESPACE` and `DESCRIPTION` 
**must** show changes.

### 4. Fix the testing infrastructure

Add two unit test cases for `rock_fun` in the standard `tests/testthat` path 
-- maybe you will need a bit of research to get it working.
One of a successful call, and one of an expected exception if `n` is 
something unexpected.
Add meaningful topics to tag the tests and run `devtools::check()`.
Finally, get rid of the original `test-split.R` file.

### 5. Commit all the changes above

Now that we know that the package passes the tests and can run 
the examples in the documentation, commit the essential changes 
from these bullets with `git`. 

Remember: **update the version number** (and the date) in `DESCRIPTION` and 
the **NEWS file**.
